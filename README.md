# Farmernest

##### India is an agricultural country and one third population depends on the agricultural  sector directly or indirectly. As food being essential need of mankind, much emphasis has been on commercialising agricultural production.

  ##### Agricultural marketing is mainly the buying and selling of agricultural products. In earlier days when the village economy was more or less self-sufficient the marketing of agricultural products presented no difficulty as the farmer sold his produce to the consumer on a cash or barter basis.

 ##### Today's agricultural marketing has to undergo a series of exchanges or transfers from one person to another before it reaches the consumer. There are three marketing functions involved in this, that are;
* assembling
* preparation for consumption
* distribution

 ##### Products are sold in various ways. For example, it might be sold at a weekly village market in the farmer's village or in a neighbouring village. If these outlets are not available, then produce might be sold at irregularly held markets in a nearby village or town, or in the Mandi.

## Importance of Agriculture Marketing

 ##### Agricultural products are perishable; therefore, a failure to sell on time results in wasted harvest. All wasted harvest represents a cost of land, water, labor, storage - and no income to show for it.

 ##### Agricultural prices can be quite variable, impacted by changes in weather and harvests in far corners of the world.

 ##### Farmers seek higher prices for their produce, and protection from price fluctuations. They may also work to open up new markets or channels, such as selling directly to consumers instead of through producers.
 
 ## Interests of Farmers, Manufacturers, Traders and Consumers in Agriculture Marketing System

##### The farmer's interest is focused on getting the best return from his produce, which usually equates to maximum price for unlimited quantities.

##### Vendors and retailers want high quality and reliable supplies from the farmer, at the most competitive prices.

##### Consumers are interested in obtaining high quality products at low prices. Clearly, there are conflicting interests here.

##### All the above points will be addressed with the farmer portal that we will be building  in this presentation
